- Looked at 4 personalities; rich/poor, accepting/judgemental, desperate/high standards, proper/scandalous.
  - Wrangled the data to the majority traits
    - e.g. Dan Humphrey is poor, therefore I calculated how 'rich' would he be.
- Character's relationships are connected based on my knowledge as this is one of my favourite TV series.
